Hey folks,

the Br√∂ring Group will attend this years [ICPP-12 in Madrid](http://www.icpp-spp.org/). 

I will present two posters at the conference - one of them will be about PorphyStruct, the other one about Isoporphyrins. Both posters will be presented at the poster session on tuesday evening (12th July 2022). 

There will be 4 more posters from our group featuring Heterocorroles, Biohybrids, and more. Martin will also give a talk at the conference.

Looking forward to seeing you there.

\- Jens
