As of today our brand-new website `PorphyStruct.org` is online.

You will find information about 

* Releases
* Upcoming Releases & Features
* Documentation/Manual for using PorphyStruct
* Conferences we attend

and more.

The Website is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and GitHub Actions and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if anyone is interested in that ðŸ˜‰
