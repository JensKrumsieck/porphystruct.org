Good news for those who don't have a Windows PC or want to use PorphyStruct on the go. PorphyStruct Web is now available at:

[https://app.porphystruct.org/ ](https://app.porphystruct.org/)

PorphyStruct Web uses the same code base as the Windows version, so the analysis data is exactly the same. Using Webassembly and .NET Blazor it is possible to run C# in the browser - and therefore also the code of PorphyStruct.

The web version is still in beta, so there will be some bugs.

Bugs can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/PorphyStruct) - as usual.
