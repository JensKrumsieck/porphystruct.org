## New Features:

* Can now apply transformations to select starting pyrrole and CW / CCW direction by Inverting the displacement diagram in Y and X Axis and shifting the starting pyrrole. 
* Selecting Atoms in either 3D View or deflection diagram will now highlight which atom is selected in a pink color.

## Changes:

* flipped saddling mode to match J.A. shelnutts definition of saddling (-> signs are flipped in simulations, compared with earlier versions)
* "Invert" ist now called "InvertY" to clarify. The simulation now updates on Inversion.
* Addded InvertX function
* Added Shift Button which basically rotates the ring if applicable (Cycle not Corrole or Corrphycene)
