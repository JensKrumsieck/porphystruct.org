On opening PorphyStruct for the first time, you will see the *Graphical User Interface* (GUI) of PorphyStruct which is divided into four main parts.

1. The menu bar is located in the upper part of the program and is used to control the program's functions. Here, for example, an analysis can be started.
2. Below there are three more sections, one of them shows the logo of PorphyStruct. Here the graph of the finished analysis will be displayed. 
3. On the right side a coordinate system can be seen. At this point a 3D representation of the molecule will be shown.
4. Below it, the results of the analysis will be displayed. In addition, the coordinates of the atoms can be viewed and quick adjustments can be made.
