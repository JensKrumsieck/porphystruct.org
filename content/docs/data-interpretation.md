The results of the analysis are given as quantitative parameters of the individual modes in Å. However, these cannot be interpreted as a percentage of the displacement parameter D<sub>oop</sub> (see definition). To obtain percentage values, the mode absolute values (without sign) must be summed up, the percentage value can be calculated by the ratio of the individual modes to their sum.

```math
\Gamma_{i} [%] = \Gamma_{i} [Å]/\sum_{\Gamma,m}|d_{\gamma}^m|
```
