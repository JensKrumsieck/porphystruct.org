### Introduction

The three-dimensional structure of each molecule `mathD_{obs}` is expressed by a linear combination of all `mathm` vibrational modes of symmetries `math\Gamma` with coefficients `mathd`. By rearranging the sum, a separation of the vibrational normal modes into out-of-plane (`mathoop`) and in-plane (`mathip`) symmetries can be made.

```math
D_{obs} = \sum_{\Gamma,m}d_m^{\Gamma} D_m^{\Gamma} = \sum_{\Gamma_{oop},m}d_m^{\Gamma_{oop}} D_m^{\Gamma_{oop}} + \sum_{\Gamma_{ip},m}d_m^{\Gamma_{ip}} D_m^{\Gamma_{ip}} = D_{obs}^{oop} + D_{obs}^{ip}
