### Introduction

The three-dimensional structure of each molecule `mathD_{obs}` is expressed by a linear combination of all `mathm` vibrational modes of symmetries `mathÎ“` with coefficients `mathd`. By rearranging the sum, a separation of the vibrational normal modes into out-of-plane (`mathoop`) and in-plane (`mathip`) symmetries can be made
